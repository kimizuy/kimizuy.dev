## WORK EXPERIENCE

### [Gaji-Labo Inc.](https://www.gaji.jp) (Tokyo, Japan) | Front-end Developer | Apr 2021 - Jan 2023 (1 yr 10 mos)

At Gaji-Labo, I participated in several projects with development periods ranging from one to six months, significantly improving user experience and site performance through various front-end technologies. In the corporate site project, I spearheaded a redesign, achieving enhanced user experience. For the equipment rental app, I executed front-end tasks, optimizing the UI and expediting REST API development with backend engineers. In the landing page project, I transitioned the codebase to TypeScript and improved Core Web Vital scores, boosting SEO significantly. Lastly, in the event app project, I led the UI design conversion and React codebase maintenance, enabling better performance and maintainability.

### [Alterbo Inc.](https://alterbo.jp) (Tokyo, Japan) | System Engineer | Feb 2019 - Mar 2020 (1 yr 2 mos)

During my tenure at Alterbo, I delivered a web application project to manage airport user data, where I led front-end development using React, Redux, and TypeScript to enhance user and flight search functionality. Additionally, I developed a Web API with Java and assisted the backend, implementing a system that centralized and digitized customer data, which dramatically enhanced airline staff productivity. Through this project, I exhibited my full-stack development capabilities, ensuring a seamless user experience and better data management for airport personnel.
